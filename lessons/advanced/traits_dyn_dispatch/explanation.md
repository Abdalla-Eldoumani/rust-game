Goal: Use trait objects for polymorphism with dynamic dispatch.

Key ideas:
- Trait object syntax: `Box<dyn Trait>`.
- Object safety rules determine which methods can be called via trait objects.
- Dynamic vs static dispatch trade-offs.

Why this matters: Enables heterogeneous collections and runtime polymorphism.
